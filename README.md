# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Machine-Learning

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems have emerged as a breakthrough in facilitating communication between individuals with speech and hearing impairments and those without.The proposed method involves filtering the hand gesture and applying a classifier to predict the corresponding ASL fingerspelling class. The experimental results demonstrate a high accuracy of 95.7% for the recognition of the 26 letters of the alphabet. This approach provides a promising avenue for improving communication between deaf-mute individuals and the general population, leveraging the power of neural networks and image processing techniques.
